# [ICLR 2023] DFPC: Data flow driven pruning of coupled channels without data.
[ICLR 2023] PyTorch code for DFPC: Data flow driven pruning of coupled channels without data.

We're working up to clean up our code and provide our models in a clean way. Everything should be up by end of May.
Coming up..
1. ~~Data-free code for pruning mobilenets~~
2. Data-driven code for pruning resnets
3. pruned models for resnet-50 in the data-driven regime.
