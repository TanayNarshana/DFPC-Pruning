TLDR: This paper introduces a novel method for pruning of networks containing coupled connections, DFPC.

We posit "coupled connections" as a bottleneck to obtain lower inference latencies when pruning networks. We then provide a formalization to abstract "coupled connections" and use it to derive a data-free way to measure the importance of coupled neurons in a network. Our experimental results display the merit in pruning "coupled connections" for they obtain pruned models with a better latency-vs-accuracy.

We're working up to clean up our code and provide our models in a clean way. Everything should be up by mid June
Coming up..
1. ~~Data-free code for pruning mobilenets~~
2. Data-driven code for pruning resnets
3. ~~pruned models for resnet-50 in the data-driven regime.~~

1. Code for data-free experiments is available in the `Data-Free` folder.
2. Pruned models for the data-driven experiment for ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset is available in the `Pruned-Models` folder.
